# Estimating total species abundance trends with spatial synchrony 
This tool is a Bayesian multivariate state-space (MARSS) model that estimates total species abundance over time using spatial synchrony. The model sums abundance trends across many populations within a species to calculate a single total abundance. Spatial synchrony can estimate trends during unsampled time periods for populations using information from nearby sampled populations. Spatial synchrony can also be toggled off. Observation error of survey methods are also estimated to inform biodiversity monitoring. This tool is intended to be generalizable for most vertebrates, which are usually counted at an annual resolution. We demonstrate the practicality this tool for all pinniped and sea turtle species with adequate data.

## File Descriptions
### Abundance Data
Global database of marine vertebrate time series for pinnipeds (LINK) and sea turtles (LINK). The data is a compilation from a literature review of marine vertebrate abundance time series by location. Data is structured in a wide format, in other words, each species location with counts is its own row. The first columns are metadata and characteristics of the data and the remaining columns are the abundance counts.

### Distance Data for Spatial Synchrony
Distances among locations for example taxa are found at DISTANCE_LINK. Distance are calculated as lengths of minimum contiguous ocean paths using CODE LINK prior to model fitting. 

### Model Files
Data pre-pocessing and model fitting code found at MODEL_LINK. Model is in Stan and found in the Stan folder. See Model description section below to get started. Model output processing files for reporting species abundance, overall abundance growth rates, observation error variability by sampling method and species, spatial synchrony relationship refer to model output files here.

### Multivariate State-space
SSMs differentiate process and observation error, which allows estimation of unobserved states while simultaneously accounting for sampling uncertainty. In the context of population dynamics, process error refers to true changes in abundance due to birth, deaths, immigration, emigrations, while observation error refers to randomness in surveys sampling abundance. This separation of process and observation error may reduce spurious interpretations of extinction risk, which should be based only on process variability

We model abundances as random walks in log space. Process variance is independent and unique by location/populaton with an independent process hypothesis, or characterized as a Gaussian process covariance function of ocean distance with a spatial synchrony hypothesis. The observation covariance matrix is diagonal, with variances that differ by sampling method category. 

Total species abundance is calculated as the sum of individual population abundances. In the pinniped examples, we calculate total abundance by subspecies when possible. 

### Bayesian
Scarce ecological data, some parameters will be difficult to estimate in a likelihood framework. The priors in the Stan examples are based on pinnipeds.

### Framework
We designed this tool to be ran at the species level. This can be modified to other taxonomic levels. Model run times will exponentially increase with # of time series in the MARSS.
